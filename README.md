# a custom LSEP loss function with class weights

This is a implementation of the log-sum-exp pairwise (LSEP) loss function for multi-label classification, i took the equation from this great article : https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05475  (ML-Net: multi-label classification of biomedical texts with deep neural networks).

The LSEP loss function is described as follow :

where 洧녭(洧논) is the label prediction function that maps the document vector 洧논 into K-dimensional label space representing the confidence scores of each label (K equals to number of unique labels). 洧녭u(洧논i) and 洧녭v(洧논i) are the 洧녺 and 洧녹 -th element of confidence 
scores for the 洧녰-th instance in the dataset, respectively. 洧녧i is the corresponding label set for the 洧녰-th instance in the dataset.
