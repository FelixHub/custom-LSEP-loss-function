# a custom LSEP loss function with class weights

This is a implementation of the log-sum-exp pairwise (LSEP) loss function for multi-label classification, i took the equation from this great article : https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05475  (ML-Net: multi-label classification of biomedical texts with deep neural networks).

The LSEP loss function is described as follow :



where 洧녭(洧논) is the label prediction function that maps the document vector 洧논 into Kdimensional label space representing the confidence scores of each label (K equals to number of unique labels). 洧녭3(洧논5) and 洧녭6(洧논5) are the 洧녺 and 洧녹 -th element of confidence 
scores for the 洧녰-th instance in the dataset, respectively. 洧녧 5 is the corresponding label set for the 洧녰-th instance in the dataset.
